// Scenario 4: Stock Market Analysis
// In a stock market analysis system, define a base class called "Stock" with a method called "getStockData" that returns an instance of the "Stock" class. Implement derived classes like "TechStock" and "PharmaStock" that override the "getStockData" method and return their specific stock data objects.

class Stock {
    Stock getStockData() {
        System.out.println("\n");
    }
}
public class StockMarketAnalysis {
    
}
