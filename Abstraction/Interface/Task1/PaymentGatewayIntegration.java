// Scenario 1: Payment Gateway Integration
// Design an interface called "PaymentGateway" with methods like "processPayment" and "refundPayment." Implement classes like "PayPalGateway" and "StripeGateway" that provide specific implementations for these interface methods.

interface PaymentGateway {
    
}
public class PaymentGatewayIntegration {
    
}
