// Scenario 7: University Management System
// Create an abstract class called "Person" with abstract methods like "registerCourse" and "submitAssignment." Implement derived classes like "Student" and "Professor" that provide specific implementations for these abstract methods.

abstract class Person {
    
}
public class UniversityManagementSystem {
    
}
